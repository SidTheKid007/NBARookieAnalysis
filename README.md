# NBA Rookie Analysis
This projeject attempts to leverage Machine Learning in python to create effective predictions for the next batch of NBA Rookies.
## 2019 College Clustering
The first file posted on this project gives a very top down view of the college stats of the players entering this years draft from college. Player data is visualized with a correlation matrix and cluster analysis to better understand the statistical distribution of players in this draft, and to look for certain similarities. The correlation matrix shows how strongly similar two varibles are just within the world of college stats. From there, the variables were decomposed, and three different methods of clusterings were employed. These three clustering methods were K-Means,Agglomerative, and Affinity Propagation, and they all all helped with visualizing similarities and overarching patterns.

*For this project, I had to webcrawl and webscrape data because there were no spreadsheets online that was extensive enough and structured to my liking. All the datasets I created for this project are now also available on Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/siddhesvark/compiled-ncaa-basketball-data)
